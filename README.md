# The Robot Arm
  This project is primarily based on the [Adeept 5-DOF Robot Arm Kit](https://a.co/d/eUZHEkD). I also used the code as a reference as well. However, I couldn't find an online repository for the code.

# Refrences 
In the reference files is the example code that came with the Robot arm kit, along with the full instructions. There are also the files I used as a reference for the Nunchuk code. However, I recommend downloading the full files. Below is a link to the reference video from GlytchTech of Hak5 along with the file download.

# More to come
  This project is a long-term one. I intend to keep it going for a good amount of time. I'm going to make everything open-source.
